**Medium Articles Suggestor & Summary Generator Agent**

A lightweight agent-driven project that aims to suggest relevant Medium articles and generate concise summaries to speed up reading and research workflows.


**Overview**

This repository hosts an agent-oriented application focused on recommending Medium articles and producing summaries, aligning with the repositoryâ€™s name and the deployed Vercel app reference. The language mix suggests a UI-heavy project with supporting Python components and JavaScript/HTML for interactivity and integration. The lack of releases and packages indicates the code is currently distributed directly from the repository.

**Features**

Medium article recommendation flow to surface relevant reads quickly.
Summary generation to condense long-form content into skimmable insights.
Web-based interface suitable for Vercel-style deployments.
